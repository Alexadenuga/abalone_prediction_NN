# abalone_prediction_NN
The price of an Abalone snail is determined by its age, and the age of the snail can only be predicted from several measurements of the shells. This study explored the machine learning method to predict the age of an Abalone snail from its physical measurements. The study used the Python programming language and the Scikit-Learn library to build the machine learning model
